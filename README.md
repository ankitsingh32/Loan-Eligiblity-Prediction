Loan Eligibility Prediction

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting loan eligibility based on various applicant attributes such as income, credit history, and loan amount. The goal is to build a machine learning model that helps financial institutions assess loan applications efficiently.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains applicant details such as:

Applicant Income,
Co-applicant Income,
Loan Amount,
Loan Term,
Credit History,
Property Area,
Loan Status (Target Variable)

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn),
Jupyter Notebook,
Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)

📊 Key Steps
Data Cleaning – Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding data distributions and correlations.
Feature Engineering – Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.
Model Training & Evaluation – Testing multiple ML algorithms and optimizing the best one.
Predictions & Insights – Generating loan approval predictions for new applicants.

🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Loan-Eligiblity-Prediction.git

Install dependencies:
bash,
Copy code,
pip install -r requirements.txt,
Open Jupyter Notebook and run Loan Eligibility Prediction.ipynb.

📈 Results & Insights
The model achieves X% accuracy on the test dataset.
Credit history and income are key factors affecting loan approval.
